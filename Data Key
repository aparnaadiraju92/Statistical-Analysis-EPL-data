Terminology:

A football match is generally 90 minutes long divided into two halves played between two team (Home team v/s Away team). Whoever is leading the match by the end of 90 minutes Wins the match. If the scores are equal, the match is considered draw. 

1. Corners - A corner kick is the method of restarting play in a game of association football when the ball goes out of play over the goal line, without a goal being scored, and having last been touched by a member of the defending team. The kick is taken from the corner of the field of play nearest to where it went out.

2. Fouls - Fouls and misconduct in football/soccer are acts committed by players which are deemed by the referee to be unfair and are subsequently penalized. An offence may be a foul, misconduct or both depending on the nature of the offence and the circumstances in which it occurs.

3. Yellow and Red Cards - A player who has been cautioned may continue playing in the game; however, a player who receives a second caution in a match is sent off (shown the yellow card again, and then a red card), meaning that he must leave the field immediately and take no further part in the game.


Some calculated fields:

•	Booking Points = Number of yellow cards * 10 + Number of Red cards * 25
•	Defense Rate = (1 - (Away Team Shots on Target / Away Team Shots)) * 100
•	Keeper Save Accuracy = (1 - (Away Team Goals / Away Team Shots on Target)) * 100
•	Shot Accuracy = (Home Team Shots on Target / Home Team Shots) * 100
•	Goal Conversion = (Home Team Goals / Home Team Shots on Target) * 100
